              When I was a child, I used to dream to become a writer– later, I realized the importance of writing truth and thus became a storyteller. I investigate, collect and present information as a story. It is very much satisfying on providing information to others. I am journalism and mass communication graduate and sociology post graduate. I adore listening to the unheard population, writing their stories and helping them to raise their spirits, hope, confidence and dream big!

                <p>Numerous NGOs, consultancies and advocacy groups play an active part in supporting the government in promoting inclusivity, influencing policies and providing support and prevention where possible to the persons with disabilities</p>
                <p>  When Dharma Devkota was five months old, she got burnt so badly that both her legs had to be amputated. In the aftermath, her muscles and joints seized up. At the time of her accident, Dharma and her family were living in the western hilly district of Surkhet. After her injury, they moved to Kailali, a district in western Terai, in search of a better environment for their daughter. </p>
                <p>  For years, Dharma was carried to school by her mother, and sometimes by her father. In rural Nepal, children generally start school when they are four or five-years-old. Dharma started when she was eight and would sometimes miss class when her mother was busy with the household chores or agricultural activities.</p>
                <p>  Now, incredibly, she is walking.</p>
                <p>  “It’s a dream come true, I have battled so long and so hard to get here. Over the years, there have been moments when I had lost all hope and felt suicidal,” said Dharma.</p>
                <p>  That is, until she met the community disability worker (CDW) through the Strengthening Rehabilitation in District Environs Programme. The CDW visited Dharma at her home and explained the process for getting artificial legs.</p>
                <p>  “I did not believe that my daughter would be able to walk and be independent,” Ranga Devi, Dharma’s mother, said. “And I never imagined that she would be able to cycle.”
                <p>  Today, at the age of 18, Dharma is strong and independent with support from her second set of artificial legs. “She learned how to cycle in the period of a week and surprised us,” her mother said.</p>
                <p>  “At first, I wasn’t happy about going to the rehab and fitting an artificial leg, but it was pure joy.”My therapists motivated me and got me excited about it,” Dharma added.</p>
                <p>  She attends school regularly, loves reading science and mathematics. She travels to school and back on her bike. She studies in grade IX and dreams of becoming a nurse someday.</p>
                <p>  It is estimated that there are 600 million people living with disabilities globally. The vast majority (80 per cent) of persons with disabilities live in low- and middle-income countries, often in difficult circumstances due to the lack of suitable services and opportunities. The needs and rights of persons with disabilities have often been overlooked in the development programmes.</p>
                <p>  As a result, numerous NGOs, consultancies and advocacy groups play an active part in supporting the government in promoting inclusivity, influencing policies and providing support and prevention where possible to the persons with disabilities.</p>
                <p>  Nepal as the state party of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD-2006) is obliged to gather comprehensive data and information of persons with disabilities (Article 31) to ensure that the services and facilities are provided according to their needs and based on priorities.</p>
                <p>  The state is also obliged, as per the constitution, to provide free health services, including medication, for persons having epilepsy and some other chronic diseases. However, so many people have little knowledge about the services or access to the granted facilities and services, consequently, resulting in the poor health condition of persons with disabilities.</p>
                <p>  Accessibility of data is a major tool in addressing the issues of persons with disabilities, such as policy formation and programme operation. The estimated number of people with disability in Nepal varies from one study to another. The National Census 2011 conducted by the government reports that 1.94 per cent of the total population of Nepal is living with some kind of disability whereas the National Living Standard Survey report (NLSS) 2011 puts it at 3.6 per cent.</p>
                <p>  However, both figures are quite low compared to the World Report on Disability (2011) by the WHO and World Bank, which shows a 15 per cent disability prevalence rate. Persons with disabilities are a stigma to the family and so are kept hidden.
                <p>  Moreover, a large number of disabled persons have not received any kind of treatment. This could be due to lack of knowledge and awareness that impairment can be treated.</p>
                <p>  The WHO has highlighted prohibitive costs, lack of appropriate services, poorly skilled health workers, and physical barriers to access as major constraining factor that hinder a healthy life for disable persons. More data are needed to understand the health needs of persons with disabilities in order to bridge the healthcare gaps.</p>
                <p>  For the past 20 years Nepal has been very active in formulating policies to enhance the rights of persons with disabilities and improve their quality of life. There have been many positive developments following the signing of the CRPD by the government, disabled people’s association as well as by other national and international agencies.</p>
                <p>  Creating awareness about the rights of persons with disabilities (Act Relating to the Rights of Person with Disability 2017) by utilising all available means, mass and mediums of information, communication and education in a new federal Nepal is a must. Activities related to social, economic and medical rehabilitation are meant to enable persons with disabilities to lead a dignified life, as in the case of Dharma. Similarly collection, translation and development of legal instruments and advocacy materials play a vital role in raising awareness among the persons with disability at the grassroots level.</p>

                <p>  Social work is an imported as well as a developing profession. To make this profession reliable, a practitioner should focus on indigenous principles, morality and methods that are appropriate in the local context. </p>
                <p>  World Social Work Day, on March 20, celebrates the contribution and impact that social workers make in society. The 2019 World Social Work Day highlights ‘Promoting the Importance of Human Relationships’. A utilitarian action targeted at enhancing the wellbeing of the community, social work is often overlooked as a discipline rather than a career, since the priorities for labour force development in a developing nation are different from those of a developed nation. </p>
                <p>  Social work today is truly an international profession. It is a practice-based profession and an academic discipline that promotes social change and development, social cohesion, and the empowerment and liberation of people. Principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility and respect for diversities are central to social work. A lot of people, however, don’t give a second thought to the social workers until they need their support.</p>
                <p>  Outlining social work is not easy. There are many forms of social work, which are difficult to encapsulate in a single definition. Instead, social work is a vast discipline that encompasses many modalities. Social work includes everything from humanitarian response missions to helping families gain access to government services, to counselling. But, one common feature in this broad concept is the tendency to seek for the betterment of the people at the individual or societal level without any return.</p>
                <p>  Social work in Nepal is not a new discovery. It can be traced back through many forms of voluntary work by religious and cultural institutions, such as the guthi (clan-based association), dharmashala (free residences for the poor) and pati pauwa (public resting place).</p>
                <p>  But formal social education began in 1996, with the first bachelor’s degree in social work at Kathmandu University. This was the only Bachelor of Arts in Social Work available in the entire country until 2005 when Purbanchal University began a Bachelor of Social Work programme at Kadambari Memorial College and a Master in Social Work at St Xavier’s College.</p>
                <p>  A lack of champions who can go an extra mile to build the profession is a problem when we look at the need to build an indigenous and globally applicable Nepalese model of social work. As a profession, social work has been introduced from western countries. Western ideology and philosophy regarding social work take precedence over the developing countries’ philosophy and viewpoint. Apparently there are differences between Nepali society and western society. If the society and cultures are different and circumstances are dissimilar, it is sure that the principles, model and practice pattern should be different.Social work should focus on indigenous circumstances. If you teach a child “A” for “airplane” it is difficult to comprehend for those children who never got a chance to see an airplane; but if you teach “A” for “ant”, it is easy to comprehend because we are familiar with ants. Social work trainees face the same kind of trouble in field work. Nepali social work trainees who go through western theories, methods and principles find it challenging to apply them in the Nepali context.</p>
                <p>  Social work is thus imported as well as a developing profession. To make this profession reliable, a practitioner should focus on indigenous principles, morality and methods that are appropriate in the local context.</p>
                <p>  The biggest problem for social work education and its growth and quality in Nepal is the absence of a clear policy with the University Grants Commission, an umbrella body responsible for the promotion and maintenance of standards of higher education. The lack of formal recognition of professional social workers by the government is also a major issue. Graduate social workers cannot compete for many government jobs as the training is not yet recognised by the Public Service Commission.</p>
                <p>  Nepal is going through a period of transition, and social work can play a crucial role in rebuilding lives and communities that have been affected due to the series of conflicts and natural calamities. Professional social work education is essential for the development of the profession. The underutilisation of social work talent due to its low recognition in the country is having an impact on the overall development of the profession.
                <p>  Social Workers Association Nepal, which was established five years back, has to be made stronger and should negotiate with the government to recognise the profession, protect the rights of social workers and ensure accountability. International organisations like the International.</p>
                <p>  Association of Schools of Social Work and regional bodies like the Asian and Pacific Association for Social Work Education should provide resources to countries like Nepal and use their expertise to boost local enterprises.</p>
                <p>  The departments and colleges offering social work courses should come together in linkage and build alliances with the media, university authorities, public servants, international contributors and other schools of social work globally. Through this, they can showcase what they are doing in Nepal. They should have clear directives and a vision of what they want to realise and allocate financial and human capitals for these objectives.</p>

                <p>The universal design concept asserts that anything and everything should be designed in order to be accessible not only to people with diverse disabilities, but more generally to the broadest possible spectrum of humanity. </p>
                <p>Each year, on December 3, the world marks International Day of People with Disabilities (IDPD) It is a day on which we promote public awareness about the challenges faced by people with disabilities, and the role communities and societies can play in eradicating the barriers to social inclusion. The theme for this year’s IDPD is “Promoting the participation of persons with disabilities and their leadership: taking action on the 2030 Development Agenda” while the national theme is “The Future is Accessible”, which means we all look towards a future without barriers.</p>
                <p>More than one billion people live with some form of disability worldwide. In the years ahead, disability will be an even greater concern due to ageing population and the higher risk of disability in older people as well as the global increase in chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health disorders. Understandably, people with disabilities have poorer health outcomes, lower education feats, less economic contribution and higher rates of poverty than people without them.</p>
                <p>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) came into force in 2008 and strengthened the understanding of disability as a human rights and development priority.</p>
                <p>A person’s environment has a huge impact on the magnitude of disability. Inaccessible environments create disability by creating hurdles to participation and inclusion. Examples of the possible negative impact of the environment are a deaf person without a sign language interpreter, a wheelchair user in a building without an accessible toilet and a blind person using a computer lacking screen-reading software. The environment could be changed to improve health conditions, prevent impairments, and improve outcomes for people with disabilities. Such changes can be fetched by legisla¬tion, policy changes, capacity building, or tech¬nological developments.</p>
                <p>Article 9 of the UNCRPD cherishes “accessibility” as one of the treaty’s eight general principles. In the preamble of the Convention, we learn that accessibility is closely tied to the evolving definition of disability. The universal design concept asserts that anything and everything should be designed in order to be accessible not only to people with diverse disabilities, but more generally to the broadest possible spectrum of humanity. For example, public buildings designed with ramps at entranceways allow for the easy movement of persons with mobility disabilities, along with pregnant women; parents with a baby carriage; people with injuries; and older persons. In the same way, for information accessibility, television programmes with subtitles and voice over ensure accessibility to people with hearing impairment as well as those watching in a noisy setting.</p>
                <p>The Sustainable Development Goals have a strong and explicit focus on disability, promulgating a socially just and human rights-based approach where development efforts include all people, even those at the very margin of the society. The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs are both evidently inclusive of people with disabilities. They can be used as an advocacy tool to draw the attention of decision-makers for the creation of disability-inclusive policies and programmes.</p>
                <p>Following Nepal’s ratification of the CRPD in 2010, the country has made notable progress in the disability sector. In 2015, Nepal adopted a democratic and an inclusive constitution, which assured a comprehensive set of rights for people with disabilities, with special provisions to ensure their access to health care, education, social justice and proportionate representation in the local bodies.</p>
                <p>The Disability Rights Act 2017, which swapped the Disabled Persons Welfare Act 1982, made a vital departure from the welfare-based approach to the rights-based approach to disability. The Act acknowledges the principles on which the CRPD was established, and amplifies the definition of persons with disabilities in line with the Convention, eliminating and banning offensive narratives.</p>
                <p>Why is there a need for disability awareness? Simply, disability is not mainstreamed and is often overlooked. Only a few people with disabilities know their rights, and deeply rooted stereotypes towards people with disabilities still exist. Civil servants must make policies to ensure there is more than just nominal representation of people with disabilities in politics.
                <p>Within the legal and policy frameworks, governments should engage the civil society and private entities in implementing initiatives to tackle inequalities of accessibility. Engaging people with disabilities throughout all stages of design, development and deployment safeguards access to products and services. This, in turn, can reduce costs and serve wider markets.</p>
                <p>The CRPD calls on States Parties to take measures on accessibility not only for government-owned facilities and services, but also in the private sector. In the federal structure, the measures should be designed in consultation with people with disabilities, disabled people’s organisations and their networks, such as the National Federation of the Disabled, Nepal. This will help to break the brutal barriers and open up better opportunities for disability-inclusive development.</p>

              <div class="description">
                <p>The 2022 International Women’s Day campaign theme #BreaktheBias calls for urgent action to counter bias and discrimination in all aspects of daily life, but importantly to combat the exclusion of girls from education. As a new UNESCO GEM Report factsheet shows, gender stereotypes and biases are built in people’s minds from childhood, limiting their futures. Biases can be reinforced or challenged through the curriculum, teaching and learning materials and practices as well as daily interactions with teachers, parents and peers. Women and girls with disabilities are among the most marginalized, excluded learners in the world and are exposed to multiple discrimination, owing to their identity as girls and as children with disabilities.</p>
                <p>“The majority of women in Nepal are discriminated across gender lines, and the patriarchal nature of Nepalese society has pushed Nepalese women to lag behind in several socio-economic dimensions. Women with disabilities face historical exclusion and multiple deprivations in all spheres of life and also in development endeavors”, accoring to the Nepal Disabled Women Association. Humanity & Inclusion and partners are working with families and local communities to ensure the right to education for girls with disabilties in Nepal.</p>
                <p>When Alina, 13, from Banke in Nepal, was young, her family realized that she had difficulties hearing. Eventually she was diagnosed as being profoundly deaf. She was accepted in a local mainstream school at the age of 8, but the school was not inclusive and she was not able to understand any lessons or communicate with teachers or friends. There were communication barriers because neither Alina nor the staff knew Nepali sign language and Alina was unable to communicate using speech. The school also had inadequate teaching and learning materials to support deaf children.  Alina had to drop out of school and lost hope she would receive an education. Growing up as a young girl who was deaf with linguistic barriers, Alina and her family were exposed to a life full of isolation and loneliness.</p>
                <p>According to the National Federation of the Deaf Nepal, more than 300,000 people are deaf or have a hearing impairment. There are 174 classrooms within mainstream schools that act as resource bases to support learners with hearing impairments, for around 11,000 students currently.</p>
                <p>Since 2018, an HI project has supported Alina through their community mobilizers that conduct counselling sessions with her parents on disability awareness and Alina’s education. Eventually, she received her disability identification card from the local government. The family were supported through the admission process and connections with school authorities were made. Finally, Alina enrolled in a school with a resource class for children with hearing impairments.</p>
                <img src="https://i0.wp.com/world-education-blog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/alina-iwd.jpg?w=668&ssl=1" alt="" srcset="">
                <p>“When she enrolled into the resource class, she changed a lot. We are happy to see her moving up to a higher class and being more dedicated to education,” says Gauni Kumari, Alina’s mother.</p>
                <p>“When she comes home, she completes her homework first and then only goes to play games with friends. As she could get educated, I am confident that she will have bright future, whether she is a girl or a boy. I am just worried for her further education,” explains Gauni Kumari. “She wants to become a police officer, but I am little afraid with her hearing impairment if that create an obstacle to peruse her dream. I’ll standby along with her to support at every stage. With sign language, she has developed her confidence and social participation I am glad to see all the changes in her life,” she adds.</p>
                <p>“When Alina arrived in the resource class, she learned letters and words quickly as she had learned basic things in the community itself by the project. She is a first student in her grade. Beside the academic subjects, she is good in extracurricular activities including sports,” says Rama Thapa, Alina’s teacher. “One thing she has to improve is English language, and I’ve placed this in priority for the coming months.”</p>
                <img src="https://i0.wp.com/world-education-blog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/roma-teahcing-sign-language.png?w=665&ssl=1" alt="">
                <p>According to Rama there are more girl children at the resource class, as there are more girls in the community in Terai region of Nepal.</p>
                <p>“Parents of the children I have met pay many concerns on their girl’s safety while staying at school, as we see growing number of incidents of violence against women such as sexual violence against girls,” says Rama. “Parents often visit school and ask me to provide vocational training after their fifth grade education, this will help them to become independent and live a dignified life in the society.”</p>
                <p>According to her parents of girls are much more concerned on their children’s future and safety. Girls from the Muslim community are often not prioritized to have an education especially when it comes to girls with a disability.</p>
                <p>“We have to pay extra effort to teach children with disabilities, but at the end of our achievement, this gives a real pleasure,” adds Rama. “When our children teach their parents about hygiene behaviors or other things when they go home, this gives me a real meaning of being a teacher.”</p>

In the years ahead, disability will be an even greater concern due to ageing population and the higher risk of disability in older people as well as the global increase in chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health disorders. Understandably, people with disabilities have poorer health outcomes, lower education feats, less economic contribution and higher rates of poverty than people without them.</p>
                <p>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) came into force in 2008 and strengthened the understanding of disability as a human rights and development priority.</p>
                <p>A person’s environment has a huge impact on the magnitude of disability. Inaccessible environments create disability by creating hurdles to participation and inclusion. Examples of the possible negative impact of the environment are a deaf person without a sign language interpreter, a wheelchair user in a building without an accessible toilet and a blind person using a computer lacking screen-reading software. The environment could be changed to improve health conditions, prevent impairments, and improve outcomes for people with disabilities. Such changes can be fetched by legisla¬tion, policy changes, capacity building, or tech¬nological developments.</p>
                <p>Article 9 of the UNCRPD cherishes “accessibility” as one of the treaty’s eight general principles. In the preamble of the Convention, we learn that accessibility is closely tied to the evolving definition of disability. The universal design concept asserts that anything and everything should be designed in order to be accessible not only to people with diverse disabilities, but more generally to the broadest possible spectrum of humanity. For example, public buildings designed with ramps at entranceways allow for the easy movement of persons with mobility disabilities, along with pregnant women; parents with a baby carriage; people with injuries; and older persons. In the same way, for information accessibility, television programmes with subtitles and voice over ensure accessibility to people with hearing impairment as well as those watching in a noisy setting.</p>
                <p>The Sustainable Development Goals have a strong and explicit focus on disability, promulgating a socially just and human rights-based approach where development efforts include all people, even those at the very margin of the society. The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs are both evidently inclusive of people with disabilities. They can be used as an advocacy tool to draw the attention of decision-makers for the creation of disability-inclusive policies and programmes.</p>
                <p>Following Nepal’s ratification of the CRPD in 2010, the country has made notable progress in the disability sector. In 2015, Nepal adopted a democratic and an inclusive constitution, which assured a comprehensive set of rights for people with disabilities, with special provisions to ensure their access to health care, education, social justice and proportionate representation in the local bodies.</p>
                <p>The Disability Rights Act 2017, which swapped the Disabled Persons Welfare Act 1982, made a vital departure from the welfare-based approach to the rights-based approach to disability. The Act acknowledges the principles on which the CRPD was established, and amplifies the definition of persons with disabilities in line with the Convention, eliminating and banning offensive narratives.</p>
                <p>Why is there a need for disability awareness? Simply, disability is not mainstreamed and is often overlooked. Only a few people with disabilities know their rights, and deeply rooted stereotypes towards people with disabilities still exist. Civil servants must make policies to ensure there is more than just nominal representation of people with disabilities in politics.
                <p>Within the legal and policy frameworks, governments should engage the civil society and private entities in implementing initiatives to tackle inequalities of accessibility. Engaging people with disabilities throughout all stages of design, development and deployment safeguards access to products and services. This, in turn, can reduce costs and serve wider markets.</p>
                <p>The CRPD calls on States Parties to take measures on accessibility not only for government-owned facilities and services, but also in the private sector. In the federal structure, the measures should be designed in consultation with people with disabilities, disabled people’s organisations and their networks, such as the National Federation of the Disabled, Nepal. This will help to break the brutal barriers and open up better opportunities for disability-inclusive development.</p>

                <p>Each year, on December 3, the world marks International Day of People with Disabilities (IDPD) It is a day on which we promote public awareness about the challenges faced by people with disabilities, and the role communities and societies can play in eradicating the barriers to social inclusion.
