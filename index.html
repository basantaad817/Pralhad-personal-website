                When I was a child, I used to dream to become a writer– later, I
                realized the importance of writing truth and thus became a
                storyteller. I investigate, collect and present information as a
                story. It is very much satisfying on providing information to
                others. I am journalism and mass communication graduate and
                sociology post graduate. I adore listening to the unheard
                population, writing their stories and helping them to raise
                their spirits, hope, confidence and dream big!

                    Numerous NGOs, consultancies and advocacy groups play an
                    active part in supporting the government in promoting
                    inclusivity, influencing policies and providing support and
                    prevention where possible to the persons with disabilities
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Dharma Devkota was five months old, she got burnt so
                    badly that both her legs had to be amputated. In the
                    aftermath, her muscles and joints seized up. At the time of
                    her accident, Dharma and her family were living in the
                    western hilly district of Surkhet. After her injury, they
                    moved to Kailali, a district in western Terai, in search of
                    a better environment for their daughter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For years, Dharma was carried to school by her mother, and
                    sometimes by her father. In rural Nepal, children generally
                    start school when they are four or five-years-old. Dharma
                    started when she was eight and would sometimes miss class
                    when her mother was busy with the household chores or
                    agricultural activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, incredibly, she is walking.</p>
                  <p>
                    “It’s a dream come true, I have battled so long and so hard
                    to get here. Over the years, there have been moments when I
                    had lost all hope and felt suicidal,” said Dharma.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That is, until she met the community disability worker (CDW)
                    through the Strengthening Rehabilitation in District
                    Environs Programme. The CDW visited Dharma at her home and
                    explained the process for getting artificial legs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “I did not believe that my daughter would be able to walk
                    and be independent,” Ranga Devi, Dharma’s mother, said. “And
                    I never imagined that she would be able to cycle.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today, at the age of 18, Dharma is strong and independent
                    with support from her second set of artificial legs. “She
                    learned how to cycle in the period of a week and surprised
                    us,” her mother said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “At first, I wasn’t happy about going to the rehab and
                    fitting an artificial leg, but it was pure joy.”My
                    therapists motivated me and got me excited about it,” Dharma
                    added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She attends school regularly, loves reading science and
                    mathematics. She travels to school and back on her bike. She
                    studies in grade IX and dreams of becoming a nurse someday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is estimated that there are 600 million people living
                    with disabilities globally. The vast majority (80 per cent)
                    of persons with disabilities live in low- and middle-income
                    countries, often in difficult circumstances due to the lack
                    of suitable services and opportunities. The needs and rights
                    of persons with disabilities have often been overlooked in
                    the development programmes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, numerous NGOs, consultancies and advocacy
                    groups play an active part in supporting the government in
                    promoting inclusivity, influencing policies and providing
                    support and prevention where possible to the persons with
                    disabilities.

                    Nepal as the state party of the Convention on the Rights of
                    Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD-2006) is obliged to gather
                    comprehensive data and information of persons with
                    disabilities (Article 31) to ensure that the services and
                    facilities are provided according to their needs and based
                    on priorities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The state is also obliged, as per the constitution, to
                    provide free health services, including medication, for
                    persons having epilepsy and some other chronic diseases.
                    However, so many people have little knowledge about the
                    services or access to the granted facilities and services,
                    consequently, resulting in the poor health condition of
                    persons with disabilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Accessibility of data is a major tool in addressing the
                    issues of persons with disabilities, such as policy
                    formation and programme operation. The estimated number of
                    people with disability in Nepal varies from one study to
                    another. The National Census 2011 conducted by the
                    government reports that 1.94 per cent of the total
                    population of Nepal is living with some kind of disability
                    whereas the National Living Standard Survey report (NLSS)
                    2011 puts it at 3.6 per cent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, both figures are quite low compared to the World
                    Report on Disability (2011) by the WHO and World Bank, which
                    shows a 15 per cent disability prevalence rate. Persons with
                    disabilities are a stigma to the family and so are kept
                    hidden.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, a large number of disabled persons have not
                    received any kind of treatment. This could be due to lack of
                    knowledge and awareness that impairment can be treated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The WHO has highlighted prohibitive costs, lack of
                    appropriate services, poorly skilled health workers, and
                    physical barriers to access as major constraining factor
                    that hinder a healthy life for disable persons. More data
                    are needed to understand the health needs of persons with
                    disabilities in order to bridge the healthcare gaps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the past 20 years Nepal has been very active in
                    formulating policies to enhance the rights of persons with
                    disabilities and improve their quality of life. There have
                    been many positive developments following the signing of the
                    CRPD by the government, disabled people’s association as
                    well as by other national and international agencies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Creating awareness about the rights of persons with
                    disabilities (Act Relating to the Rights of Person with
                    Disability 2017) by utilising all available means, mass and
                    mediums of information, communication and education in a new
                    federal Nepal is a must. Activities related to social,
                    economic and medical rehabilitation are meant to enable
                    persons with disabilities to lead a dignified life, as in
                    the case of Dharma. Similarly collection, translation and
                    development of legal instruments and advocacy materials play
                    a vital role in raising awareness among the persons with
                    disability at the grassroots level.

                    Social work is an imported as well as a developing
                    profession. To make this profession reliable, a practitioner
                    should focus on indigenous principles, morality and methods
                    that are appropriate in the local context.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    World Social Work Day, on March 20, celebrates the
                    contribution and impact that social workers make in society.
                    The 2019 World Social Work Day highlights ‘Promoting the
                    Importance of Human Relationships’. A utilitarian action
                    targeted at enhancing the wellbeing of the community, social
                    work is often overlooked as a discipline rather than a
                    career, since the priorities for labour force development in
                    a developing nation are different from those of a developed
                    nation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Social work today is truly an international profession. It
                    is a practice-based profession and an academic discipline
                    that promotes social change and development, social
                    cohesion, and the empowerment and liberation of people.
                    Principles of social justice, human rights, collective
                    responsibility and respect for diversities are central to
                    social work. A lot of people, however, don’t give a second
                    thought to the social workers until they need their support.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Outlining social work is not easy. There are many forms of
                    social work, which are difficult to encapsulate in a single
                    definition. Instead, social work is a vast discipline that
                    encompasses many modalities. Social work includes everything
                    from humanitarian response missions to helping families gain
                    access to government services, to counselling. But, one
                    common feature in this broad concept is the tendency to seek
                    for the betterment of the people at the individual or
                    societal level without any return.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Social work in Nepal is not a new discovery. It can be
                    traced back through many forms of voluntary work by
                    religious and cultural institutions, such as the guthi
                    (clan-based association), dharmashala (free residences for
                    the poor) and pati pauwa (public resting place).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But formal social education began in 1996, with the first
                    bachelor’s degree in social work at Kathmandu University.
                    This was the only Bachelor of Arts in Social Work available
                    in the entire country until 2005 when Purbanchal University
                    began a Bachelor of Social Work programme at Kadambari
                    Memorial College and a Master in Social Work at St Xavier’s
                    College.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A lack of champions who can go an extra mile to build the
                    profession is a problem when we look at the need to build an
                    indigenous and globally applicable Nepalese model of social
                    work. As a profession, social work has been introduced from
                    western countries. Western ideology and philosophy regarding
                    social work take precedence over the developing countries’
                    philosophy and viewpoint. Apparently there are differences
                    between Nepali society and western society. If the society
                    and cultures are different and circumstances are dissimilar,
                    it is sure that the principles, model and practice pattern
                    should be different.Social work should focus on indigenous
                    circumstances. If you teach a child “A” for “airplane” it is
                    difficult to comprehend for those children who never got a
                    chance to see an airplane; but if you teach “A” for “ant”,
                    it is easy to comprehend because we are familiar with ants.
                    Social work trainees face the same kind of trouble in field
                    work. Nepali social work trainees who go through western
                    theories, methods and principles find it challenging to
                    apply them in the Nepali context.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Social work is thus imported as well as a developing
                    profession. To make this profession reliable, a practitioner
                    should focus on indigenous principles, morality and methods
                    that are appropriate in the local context.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The biggest problem for social work education and its growth
                    and quality in Nepal is the absence of a clear policy with
                    the University Grants Commission, an umbrella body
                    responsible for the promotion and maintenance of standards
                    of higher education. The lack of formal recognition of
                    professional social workers by the government is also a
                    major issue. Graduate social workers cannot compete for many
                    government jobs as the training is not yet recognised by the
                    Public Service Commission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nepal is going through a period of transition, and social
                    work can play a crucial role in rebuilding lives and
                    communities that have been affected due to the series of
                    conflicts and natural calamities. Professional social work
                    education is essential for the development of the
                    profession. The underutilisation of social work talent due
                    to its low recognition in the country is having an impact on
                    the overall development of the profession.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Social Workers Association Nepal, which was established five
                    years back, has to be made stronger and should negotiate
                    with the government to recognise the profession, protect the
                    rights of social workers and ensure accountability.
                    International organisations like the International.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Association of Schools of Social Work and regional bodies
                    like the Asian and Pacific Association for Social Work
                    Education should provide resources to countries like Nepal
                    and use their expertise to boost local enterprises.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The departments and colleges offering social work courses
                    should come together in linkage and build alliances with the
                    media, university authorities, public servants,
                    international contributors and other schools of social work
                    globally. Through this, they can showcase what they are
                    doing in Nepal. They should have clear directives and a
                    vision of what they want to realise and allocate financial
                    and human capitals for these objectives.

                    Each year, on December 3, the world marks International Day
                    of People with Disabilities (IDPD) It is a day on which we
                    promote public awareness about the challenges faced by
                    people with disabilities, and the role communities and
                    societies can play in eradicating the barriers to social
                    inclusion. The theme for this year’s IDPD is “Promoting the
                    participation of persons with disabilities and their
                    leadership: taking action on the 2030 Development Agenda”

                    More than one billion people live with some form of
                    disability worldwide. In the years ahead, disability will be
                    an even greater concern due to ageing population and the
                    higher risk of disability in older people as well as the
                    global increase in chronic health conditions, such as
                    diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health
                    disorders. Understandably, people with disabilities have
                    poorer health outcomes, lower education feats, less economic
                    contribution and higher rates of poverty than people without
                    them.

                    The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with
                    Disabilities (CRPD) came into force in 2008 and strengthened
                    the understanding of disability as a human rights and
                    development priority.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A person’s environment has a huge impact on the magnitude of
                    disability. Inaccessible environments create disability by
                    creating hurdles to participation and inclusion. Examples of
                    the possible negative impact of the environment are a deaf
                    person without a sign language interpreter, a wheelchair
                    user in a building without an accessible toilet and a blind
                    person using a computer lacking screen-reading software. The
                    environment could be changed to improve health conditions,
                    prevent impairments, and improve outcomes for people with
                    disabilities. Such changes can be fetched by legisla¬tion,
                    policy changes, capacity building, or tech¬nological
                    developments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Article 9 of the UNCRPD cherishes “accessibility” as one of
                    the treaty’s eight general principles. In the preamble of
                    the Convention, we learn that accessibility is closely tied
                    to the evolving definition of disability. The universal
                    design concept asserts that anything and everything should
                    be designed in order to be accessible not only to people
                    with diverse disabilities, but more generally to the
                    broadest possible spectrum of humanity. For example, public
                    buildings designed with ramps at entranceways allow for the
                    easy movement of persons with mobility disabilities, along
                    with pregnant women; parents with a baby carriage; people
                    with injuries; and older persons. In the same way, for
                    information accessibility, television programmes with
                    subtitles and voice over ensure accessibility to people with
                    hearing impairment as well as those watching in a noisy
                    setting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Sustainable Development Goals have a strong and explicit
                    focus on disability, promulgating a socially just and human
                    rights-based approach where development efforts include all
                    people, even those at the very margin of the society. The
                    2030 Agenda and the SDGs are both evidently inclusive of
                    people with disabilities. They can be used as an advocacy
                    tool to draw the attention of decision-makers for the
                    creation of disability-inclusive policies and programmes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Following Nepal’s ratification of the CRPD in 2010, the
                    country has made notable progress in the disability sector.
                    In 2015, Nepal adopted a democratic and an inclusive
                    constitution, which assured a comprehensive set of rights
                    for people with disabilities, with special provisions to
                    ensure their access to health care, education, social
                    justice and proportionate representation in the local
                    bodies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Disability Rights Act 2017, which swapped the Disabled
                    Persons Welfare Act 1982, made a vital departure from the
                    welfare-based approach to the rights-based approach to
                    disability. The Act acknowledges the principles on which the
                    CRPD was established, and amplifies the definition of
                    persons with disabilities in line with the Convention,
                    eliminating and banning offensive narratives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Why is there a need for disability awareness? Simply,
                    disability is not mainstreamed and is often overlooked. Only
                    a few people with disabilities know their rights, and deeply
                    rooted stereotypes towards people with disabilities still
                    exist. Civil servants must make policies to ensure there is
                    more than just nominal representation of people with
                    disabilities in politics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Within the legal and policy frameworks, governments should
                    engage the civil society and private entities in
                    implementing initiatives to tackle inequalities of
                    accessibility. Engaging people with disabilities throughout
                    all stages of design, development and deployment safeguards
                    access to products and services. This, in turn, can reduce
                    costs and serve wider markets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The CRPD calls on States Parties to take measures on
                    accessibility not only for government-owned facilities and
                    services, but also in the private sector. In the federal
                    structure, the measures should be designed in consultation
                    with people with disabilities, disabled people’s
                    organisations and their networks, such as the National
                    Federation of the Disabled, Nepal. This will help to break
                    the brutal barriers and open up better opportunities for
                    disability-inclusive development.

                    The 2022 International Women’s Day campaign theme
                    #BreaktheBias calls for urgent action to counter bias and
                    discrimination in all aspects of daily life, but importantly
                    to combat the exclusion of girls from education. As a new
                    UNESCO GEM Report factsheet shows, gender stereotypes and
                    biases are built in people’s minds from childhood, limiting
                    their futures. Biases can be reinforced or challenged
                    through the curriculum, teaching and learning materials and
                    practices as well as daily interactions with teachers,
                    parents and peers. Women and girls with disabilities are
                    among the most marginalized, excluded learners in the world
                    and are exposed to multiple discrimination, owing to their
                    identity as girls and as children with disabilities.

                    “The majority of women in Nepal are discriminated across
                    gender lines, and the patriarchal nature of Nepalese society
                    has pushed Nepalese women to lag behind in several
                    socio-economic dimensions. Women with disabilities face
                    historical exclusion and multiple deprivations in all
                    spheres of life and also in development endeavors”, accoring
                    to the Nepal Disabled Women Association. Humanity &
                    Inclusion and partners are working with families and local
                    communities to ensure the right to education for girls with
                    disabilties in Nepal.

                    When Alina, 13, from Banke in Nepal, was young, her family
                    realized that she had difficulties hearing. Eventually she
                    was diagnosed as being profoundly deaf. She was accepted in
                    a local mainstream school at the age of 8, but the school
                    was not inclusive and she was not able to understand any
                    lessons or communicate with teachers or friends. There were
                    communication barriers because neither Alina nor the staff
                    knew Nepali sign language and Alina was unable to
                    communicate using speech. The school also had inadequate
                    teaching and learning materials to support deaf children.
                    Alina had to drop out of school and lost hope she would
                    receive an education. Growing up as a young girl who was
                    deaf with linguistic barriers, Alina and her family were
                    exposed to a life full of isolation and loneliness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the National Federation of the Deaf Nepal, more
                    than 300,000 people are deaf or have a hearing impairment.
                    There are 174 classrooms within mainstream schools that act
                    as resource bases to support learners with hearing
                    impairments, for around 11,000 students currently.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since 2018, an HI project has supported Alina through their
                    community mobilizers that conduct counselling sessions with
                    her parents on disability awareness and Alina’s education.
                    Eventually, she received her disability identification card
                    from the local government. The family were supported through
                    the admission process and connections with school
                    authorities were made. Finally, Alina enrolled in a school
                    with a resource class for children with hearing impairments.
                  </p>

                    “When she enrolled into the resource class, she changed a
                    lot. We are happy to see her moving up to a higher class and
                    being more dedicated to education,” says Gauni Kumari,
                    Alina’s mother.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “When she comes home, she completes her homework first and
                    then only goes to play games with friends. As she could get
                    educated, I am confident that she will have bright future,
                    whether she is a girl or a boy. I am just worried for her
                    further education,” explains Gauni Kumari. “She wants to
                    become a police officer, but I am little afraid with her
                    hearing impairment if that create an obstacle to peruse her
                    dream. I’ll standby along with her to support at every
                    stage. With sign language, she has developed her confidence
                    and social participation I am glad to see all the changes in
                    her life,” she adds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “When Alina arrived in the resource class, she learned
                    letters and words quickly as she had learned basic things in
                    the community itself by the project. She is a first student
                    in her grade. Beside the academic subjects, she is good in
                    extracurricular activities including sports,” says Rama
                    Thapa, Alina’s teacher. “One thing she has to improve is
                    English language, and I’ve placed this in priority for the
                    coming months.”

                  <p>
                    According to Rama there are more girl children at the
                    resource class, as there are more girls in the community in
                    Terai region of Nepal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Parents of the children I have met pay many concerns on
                    their girl’s safety while staying at school, as we see
                    growing number of incidents of violence against women such
                    as sexual violence against girls,” says Rama. “Parents often
                    visit school and ask me to provide vocational training after
                    their fifth grade education, this will help them to become
                    independent and live a dignified life in the society.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to her parents of girls are much more concerned on
                    their children’s future and safety. Girls from the Muslim
                    community are often not prioritized to have an education
                    especially when it comes to girls with a disability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We have to pay extra effort to teach children with
                    disabilities, but at the end of our achievement, this gives
                    a real pleasure,” adds Rama. “When our children teach their
                    parents about hygiene behaviors or other things when they go
                    home, this gives me a real meaning of being a teacher.”

                    "I am hurt every time I receive an email in a pdf* format or
                    an image. The screen-reading tool I use will not be able to
                    read this. I need someone to read that to me, which can be
                    disgusting," said Sujit Gurung, a person with visual
                    impairment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gurung stated that while using Facebook, the captions of all
                    pictures do not adequately describe the picture and
                    auto-generated texts are also insufficient to understand the
                    picture. Social media has now become part of our everyday
                    lives. As social media use increases, both personally and
                    professionally, it's important to ensure that your friends
                    and followers can access content in different ways.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Accessibility is not just physical; like access to public
                    buildings or workplaces or roads. It is also important to
                    ensure that the messages you share on social media are
                    likely to reach everyone. With millions of people using
                    social networking channels worldwide, it is vital to
                    consider accessibility online.

                  <p>
                    Social media is the fastest-growing marketing tool, allowing
                    people to promote their businesses, disseminate public
                    service messages and connect with friends and clients in a
                    short time. But how can you make this accessible to all? To
                    ensure that everyone can access your information, bake in
                    accessibility. Adding captions to your videos or adding sign
                    language interpretation makes it accessible for many more
                    people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition, short sentences accompanied with pictures and
                    illustrations, called 'easy reading' format; help make the
                    content welcoming for people with learning and memory
                    difficulties. Easy read is information written using simple
                    words and short sentences. This is supported by images that
                    refer to the meaning of the sentences. It can be useful for
                    other people too, for example, people with low literacy
                    levels, people recovering from a stroke, or living with
                    dementia will find the content more inviting.

                  <p>
                    Article 9 of the United Nation’s Convention on Rights of
                    Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) gives us a guide. It states
                    that- “People with disabilities have the right to
                    participate in all aspects of society on an equal basis with
                    others. That includes accessing the physical environment,
                    transportation, information and communications, and other
                    facilities and services provided to the public." As of date,
                    this has been ratified by 182 countries and is legally
                    binding for those, including Nepal. The convention
                    recognizes the importance of accessibility to information
                    and communication and states that information in accessible
                    formats has to be provided as a reasonable accommodation.

                    Globally, social media use is growing every day – even more
                    so since the COVID-19 pandemic. Making your social media
                    posts accessible is the right thing to do to be more
                    inclusive to the people with accessibility needs. But what
                    are the other benefits? Firstly, you will reach a wider
                    audience. People with disabilities often represent the
                    largest untapped audience in the world. Secondly, being
                    known for a commitment to accessibility is good for any
                    organization or business. Audiences are increasingly
                    favouring values-led brands, especially those that genuinely
                    commit to diversity and inclusion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Accessibility is essential for connecting with your full
                    potential audience. More than one billion people live with
                    some form of disability - 15% of the worldwide population.
                    Those numbers skyrocket when you include temporary and
                    situational disabilities. In essence, non-inclusive content
                    separates a large segment of the global population. Simply
                    put: Accessibility adds value.
                  </p>
                  <h6>What does it mean to be accessible?</h6>
                  <p>
                    Don't forget that not all of your social media followers
                    will require the same level of access to technology. For
                    instance, those with visual impairments may use screen
                    readers. Deaf or hard-of-hearing people may need to use sign
                    language. Some people may have learning, reading, or sensory
                    needs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Online engagement is more fun when everyone can participate.
                    Due to the open nature and accessibility of social media,
                    people are also using it as a means of therapy, or as a way
                    to discuss subjects that are stigmatised, such as mental
                    health. Through social media, a more equal and open society
                    can be developed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can easily make your social content easier to access for
                    people who are blind, deaf or have an intellectual
                    disability by doing some easy things.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When uploading images to Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and
                    Instagram, remember to add ALT TEXT. This provides a basic,
                    written description for each image. This will be read out to
                    people using screen-reading technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Screen readers may not be able to read memes or gifs. In
                    your post text, provide a description that conveys meaning.
                    Plain text is best.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Remember to use the first letter of each word is
                    capitalised, and it makes hashtags much #EasierToRead for
                    people using screen readers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The use of captions is preferable to subtitles, since
                    captions describe all speech and sound, including background
                    noise and music, ensuring full access to all video content.
                    These days, a lot of social media users watch videos with
                    the sound off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It may be more convenient for those with screen readers to
                    view transcripts of videos than captions. For those who are
                    short on time and would like to skip to the most important
                    information, transcripts are also very useful.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Stories, such as Facebook or Instagram stories, are very
                    popular on social media. Please be aware that text and
                    images on stories won't be read by screen readers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As technology and social media advance, accessibility for
                    people with disabilities is gaining ground. A caption on
                    your social media and website can help ensure accessibility
                    for the Deaf community. Content that has captions tends to
                    be more engaging than content without captions. Whether
                    you're creating content for your personal or professional
                    use, accessibility is key.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, you will be inclusive, welcoming, and
                    considerate of people who use different methods to access
                    information. Use the practical tips and advice above to make
                    your content accessible and inclusive, so more of your
                    followers will enjoy it.

                    KATHMANDU (IDN) — Can a mobile app become the transformative
                    tool that will allow thousands of vulnerable children to
                    enjoy their right to education?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This is the bet that is being made by a consortium of
                    agencies working in Nepal to enhance the rights of children
                    who are deaf and hard of hearing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If most of the children suffered a lot during the Covid-19
                    lockdown due to the fact that they could not attend their
                    classroom and an alternative system put in place was not
                    adequate to meet their needs, those who are deaf or hard of
                    hearing, are among those who paid the highest consequences.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Sadhana, 10, acquired hearing impairment when she went
                    through an unknown disease during her childhood. Sadhana
                    likes drawing and sewing. Her family has been consistently
                    worried about her education and future.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Before the pandemic, Sadhana was lucky enough to be able to
                    attend a Resource Class, an additional class at a mainstream
                    school to support the special needs of the children with
                    disabilities, such as those who are deaf, blind or have
                    intellectual disabilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, at the school, both children with and without
                    disabilities learn together with their peers. Even though
                    there she was facing difficulties, a protected learning
                    environment was available to her.
                  </p>

                  <p>The pandemic changed all this.</p>
                  <p>
                    The Resource Class was hers only hope but the closure of
                    academics shattered their hope while creating learning loss.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sadhana is one of the many facing daunting challenges in
                    enjoying their right to education.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now a mobile app, Mero Sanket, developed by the USAID
                    supported Reading for All program, could help change the
                    status quo.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As implementing partners, a coalition of organizations
                    including Humanity & Inclusion, World Education, National
                    Federation of the Deaf Nepal (NDFN), Center for Education
                    and Human Resource Development (CEHRD), are working full
                    steam to ensure the app will reach as many as possible
                    children in need of it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While a full assessment of Mero Sanket’s effectiveness will
                    require time as it was launched just on the occasion of the
                    International Day of Sign Languages, commemorated each year
                    on the 23rd September, technological advancement,
                    complemented by interventions in the sphere of policymaking,
                    could make a true difference.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The quest for a more inclusive education system in Nepal is
                    not a minor issue considering the thousands of children with
                    disabilities who, on daily basis, encounter barriers to
                    their rights posed by stereotypes and exclusion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To give an idea of the numbers involved, only students who
                    are deaf or hard of hearing in the country are over 15,000.
                    As in Sadhana’s case, there is a system in place tailored
                    made to the special needs of deaf and hard of hearing kids.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to the “Resource Classrooms”, the backbone of an
                    educational system that strives to be inclusive, there are
                    22 specialized schools targeting children with hearing
                    impairments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The approach to inclusive education undertaken by Nepal,
                    though requires considerable improvements, testifies the
                    progress being made by the country in making its learning
                    system more equal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mero Sanket could be the starting point to reinforce this
                    system but now, its contents are only focused on children
                    from Grade 1 to Grade 3. In a short span of time, the app
                    introduced thanks to an extensive network of community
                    workers, is already making a huge difference.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Abhishek, 12, acquired hearing loss when he was 6 years old.
                    He only had the chance to get enrolled in Resource Class in
                    the western district of Dang in 2021 but he also had to
                    discontinue his learning due to the Covid lockdowns.
                  </p>
                  <p>Mero Sanket helped fill the gap.</p>

                  <p>
                    “My son used to dress up himself and wait for the learning
                    facilitator,” told Abhishek’s father, referring to the local
                    instructors introducing the app to the children, helping
                    them continue with their learning during the schools
                    ‘closure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We are now so happy to see the engagement and progress of
                    our son in learning” he added. Initially, Abishek didn’t
                    seem interested and unconvincing. Later with the
                    facilitation and motivations from the community workers, he
                    agreed to learn. Later he found it so interesting to learn
                    through pictures and sign languages available at the app”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sapana Pokhrel is one of the learning facilitators from
                    Surkhet, in western Nepal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since the launch of the app, instructors like her have been
                    instrumental in providing educational support to deaf and
                    hard of hearing children.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “This app is very useful for those who even don’t know
                    Nepali sign language. They can learn and teach to the deaf
                    children”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She continues: “The self-evaluation session in this app is
                    very useful. This is also practical as it enables
                    discussions on daily use activities such as greetings, food,
                    hygiene and sanitation activities.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With Mero Sanket slowly getting more and more traction, two
                    challenges need to be tackled on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First how the use of new technologies can be mainstreamed
                    across the curriculum, complimenting, strengthening, rather
                    than abruptly disrupting, the existing model of inclusive
                    education.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Children might feel bored on learning all the time with the
                    teachers and their lectures but mobile app has made their
                    learning more independent, fun and interesting” shares
                    Sapana.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps the lessons that are still be drawn from the
                    challenges of imparting education during a pandemic and the
                    impact of such shift had on millions of children, is going
                    to help revisit traditional approaches to education.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is very possible that hybrid forms of onsite education
                    combined with online, technology-enhanced sessions will have
                    experimented further. For sure technology alone is not
                    enough.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Children”, shares Sapana, “should be properly guided to use
                    mobile technology through a routine use and monitoring from
                    the teachers so that their addiction to the phone or any
                    negative consequences on health can be prevented.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finding the right balance between tailored made educational
                    innovation and enhanced and improved traditional
                    methodologies is not going to be easy but their
                    opportunities are to be explored.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second challenge is how to ensure higher education for
                    deaf and hard of hearing children are more widely available.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “This app puts Nepali Sign Language into the hands of anyone
                    with an interest in learning it. We wish to take more
                    initiatives to promote inclusive education by developing an
                    additional learning material together and to lay the
                    groundwork for more expanded education of deaf children”, a
                    statement of the National Federation of the Deaf Nepal
                    explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We need to scale up apps like Mero Sanke as much as possible
                    and also ensure that these new tools can promote learning
                    materials for the entire 12 years of mandatory education as
                    per law’s requirements in Nepal and go even further.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are only a few options of secondary education with
                    only three out of the 22 specialized schools for the deaf in
                    Nepal providing the entire 12 mandatory years of education.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Compounding the problem, in the entire country there is only
                    one undergraduate-level learning institution for deaf
                    students and there is no master-level course for them.
                  </p>
                  <p>Mero Sanket offers a first important step.</p>
                  <p>
                    We hope this app and other similar that might come, can
                    become also a catalyst for more opportunities in higher
                    education for deaf and hard of hearing students.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For now, at least, the younger ones will surely have a
                    better chance to exercise their right to education and
                    develop their learning and with it, their sense of agency.

                    Now we will have to ensure that new digital innovations can
                    help unblock the status quo while at the same time it is
                    paramount to better understand how new technological devices
                    can enhance the learning of children who are deaf and hard
                    of hearing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the past one and a half years, there have been a lot of
                    discussions on the right to education for vulnerable
                    children and the impact that the lockdown and with it, the
                    implications of online education, had on them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Much neglected and overlooked instead was the situation
                    faced by children and youth who are deaf and hard of
                    hearing, an important component of the student population
                    that always remains at the margins of the conversation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It should not be this way and the reason is simple: the
                    numbers are staggering.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Nepal, 15,000 deaf students attend 22 specialized schools
                    and 174 resource classrooms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the National Federation of the Deaf
                    Nepal(NDFN), there are around 4,000 students in the former
                    that exclusively meet the needs of students with hearing
                    impairment while in the latter, there are approximately
                    11,000 students enrolled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This group of resource classrooms is a positive example of
                    integration as we are talking about “teaching units”
                    dedicated to deaf and hard of hearing children within the
                    “mainstream” schools- where children with and without
                    disabilities learn together.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The real problem is that for such a vast target group, only
                    three out of the 22 specialized schools for the deaf in
                    Nepal provide 12 years of school education — 1st to 12th
                    grade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The landscape clearly portrays an outright violation of the
                    right to education for the vast majority of these children
                    and youth, a situation that is further aggravated if we
                    think that only one school, Central Higher Secondary School
                    for the Deaf, situated in the federal capital, provides
                    higher education but only for Bachelors’ degrees in
                    Education and Management.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It means that for example if you are a talented female
                    student with hearing impairments and your dream is to study
                    engineering, your future is completely shattered and the
                    options available do vastly limit your pathway toward a
                    meaningful career.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In short, you have to adjust and adapt to an unfair and
                    unjust society.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This should not happen in a nation that boasts a
                    constitution for its inclusiveness and progressive features.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a country where, according to NDFN, there is a population
                    of more than 300,000 people who are deaf or have hearing
                    impairment, this is a cautionary tale that there is only so
                    much that children and youth with hearing impairment can do.
                  </p>
                  <p>It should not be this way.</p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, only now Nepali Sign Language is being discovered
                    though the vast majority of adults who are deaf will
                    continue to make do and carry on with their lives without
                    being able to fully communicate with the rest of the
                    society.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you consider that this medium of communication was
                    developed in 1998, you can realize how many citizens’ lives
                    have been obstructed and denied an opportunity for
                    self-development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The road toward a more inclusive, just society is a long and
                    rough one and the rights of persons with hearing impairment,
                    either deafness or hard of hearing, should be considered and
                    fought for in unison with other citizens who are
                    discriminated against on a daily basis even if no one takes
                    notice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We are talking about the inviolable rights of other members
                    of vulnerable groups, not only other segments of the
                    population living with disabilities but also those of
                    communities who are historically marginalized like dalit,
                    the vast majority of madhesis, indigenous groups and of
                    course, women, a community thoroughly discriminated against.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it is essential to pursue a common front to call for
                    the upholding of the rights of all these key members of
                    society, it is also vital to promote specific, tailor-made
                    solutions focused on the unique needs of such members.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Investing in education is one of the surest interventions to
                    start with - one that should open up a myriad of
                    opportunities and other complementary actions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the case of children and youth with hearing impairment,
                    it means more resources focused on strengthening the network
                    of resource classes, ensuring that children attending them
                    also have opportunities to interact and spend time with
                    their peers attending the “mainstream” classes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is also about enlarging the options at higher education
                    levels through specialized programs but also - and this
                    should be the overarching goal - through efforts to turn
                    colleges and universities more attentive and inclusive of
                    the rights of students with unique needs like those with
                    hearing impairments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another essential step is to create a level playing field in
                    the domain of digital education.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We should not forget that, while the rights of the vast
                    majority of vulnerable kids have been neglected and
                    violated, over the entire lockdowns, those who are deaf and
                    hard of hearing paid the utmost consequences as there was
                    not any digital tool available to them and as a consequence,
                    no learning happened.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though this is shocking, it is part of a consistent pattern.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this regard, an important step has been recently taken
                    when the first-ever Nepali sign language app was launched,
                    on the 23rd September 2021, on the occasion of the
                    International Day of Sign Languages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Called, “MeroSanket”, it was developed by a consortium
                    including Handicap International, also known as Humanity &
                    Inclusion in partnership with the National Federation of the
                    Deaf Nepal (NDFN), the Center for Education and Human
                    Resource Development (CEHRD), World Education and with
                    funding support from the USAID.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the most important features of MeroSanket is that it
                    can be used not only by students, including those at
                    pre-literacy levels but can also be a useful tool for
                    everyone else in society interested to learn Nepali sign
                    language.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fact that the federal government, through CEHRD, was
                    fully involved and provided guidance in the development of
                    the app, is significant and promising.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yet existing provisions must be enforced. For example,
                    Nepal’s 2017 Disability Rights Act (section 23.2) provides
                    for special training for teachers who educate children with
                    disabilities to promote their access to quality education
                    but does not mention training for teachers in inclusive
                    education. Training is focused on developing specialized
                    teachers, rather than training all teachers in inclusive
                    methods that will benefit diverse learners.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition, the act also states- “The Government of Nepal
                    shall make freely available the educational materials as
                    prescribed to the schools in order to ensure the access of
                    the students with disabilities to schools and learning.” But
                    this lacks proper implementation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now we will have to ensure that new digital innovations can
                    help unblock the status quo while at the same time it is
                    paramount to better understand how new technological devices
                    can enhance the learning of children who are deaf and hard
                    of hearing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They can truly make a whole of difference but at the same
                    time, a much stronger holistic effort at national and local
                    levels must be made to ensure not only the rights of
                    children and youth with hearing impairments but also those
                    of their peers from other marginalized groups are fulfilled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Optimistically, a digital app can become a propeller for
                    more actions in the field of inclusive education.
                  </p>

                    People care about the words they use," my friend said in a conversation about empowerment and inclusion. “Good intentions and thoughts are more important than the words,” he added. The incident made this scribe realise that it is necessary to learn about the perspective of people with disabilities and share it with others. The writer of many media articles about people with disabilities, usually promoting some form of inspiration, often confuses us when they claim that the individual somehow “overcame” his or her disability. Why is it that despite doing something that anyone else would celebrate, the focus becomes on overcoming their disability, which in many cases is completely irrelevant? Is it not possible to congratulate people with disabilities for what they have accomplished without mentioning their disability?
                  </p>
                  <h6>Appropriate phrases</h6>
                  <p>
                    There are many conversations and platforms that contain problematic statements for people with disabilities. “An appropriate phrase for someone overcoming a disability is “differently abled.” Unfortunately, this statement holds two very important errors. Firstly, differently abled isn't the right term for a person with a disability. The term disability isn't offensive to people living with disabilities. Secondly, people with disabilities aren't overcoming their disability. This statement ineptly limits the definition of a disability to the medical model of disability, which focuses on an individual’s functions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The achievements of people with disabilities should be used to enhance awareness of disability, but without the right wording, this isn't possible. Instead of “overcoming,” writers should describe how a person with disabilities has “challenged” an inaccessible and exclusive society and context.  Fortunately, we’re seeing a shift from the strict medical model of what a disability is to the social model, recognising that a person’s activities are limited not by  their physical condition but by the environment and society.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention defines disability as any condition of the body or mind that makes it more difficult for the person with the condition to do certain activities and interact with the world around them. Although “people with disabilities” sometimes refers to a single population, this community is actually a diverse group of people with a wide range of needs. Two people with the same type of disability can be affected in very different ways. Some disabilities may be hidden or not easy to see. Some may be more accepted by societal norms. In many cases, the way we describe and write about disability creates disabling effects in itself, reads a statement at CDC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    People with disabilities prefer to view their experiences from the social model of disability. This means, if they need to overcome anything as a community, it is systemic barriers, discrimination, and misrepresentation — not their disability. Throughout history, language has evolved. Cultural trends and changes have impacted the words we use today. “Language is super important when it comes to identity and community, and how we want to be represented in this world,” says Shiva Acharya, a disability rights expert. “My advice to you would be to never hesitate to use the words disability or disabled. These terms do not embarrass, break, or humiliate us. The actual live experience of disability itself does not embed terms like disability in shame, but rather the practice of changing language does,” Acharya adds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     “I am a wheelchair user, not a wheelchair bound,” mentions Gajendra Budhathoki, a journalist, on his Twitter. Are you ever curious about what words to avoid while communicating with or about people with disabilities? Simply, put people first. For example: a wheelchair user versus wheelchair-bound, person with autism versus autistic person, person who is hard of hearing versus hearing-impaired.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First and foremost, we are all people, so it makes sense to use language that is people-centred.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Adding the phrase “person who” to your language will make it more compelling. With such changes, you illustrate your commitment to putting individuals before their disabilities. In today's society, the terms “handicapped,” “able-bodied,” “physically challenged,” and “differently abled” are outdated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You should never use the word “normal” to describe people without disabilities in contrast to people with disabilities. You should instead say “non-disabled.” In this example, do not use “She did just as well on the exam as the normal students.” Instead, use “She did very well on her exam.” The words “victim” or “sufferer” should never be used to describe anyone with a disability or a disease, as they imply helplessness and dehumanise the individual. A person with HIV/ AIDS is not an “AIDS sufferer.” Rather, use “person with HIV/AIDS.”
                  </p>
                  <h6>Dignified terms</h6>
                  <p>
                    Even without realising it, the words we use depict our approach and the mindset we are already bringing to a project, conversation, or relationship. It influences how disabled people are perceived and treated in society. If you are in doubt about what language you should be using, just ask someone from the disability community.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Disability inclusive language choices foster respect, access, autonomy, equity, self-determination, opportunity, inclusion, and interdependence for the disability community. On the official website of the National Federation of the Disabled- Nepal, you will find an overview of dignified terms used in Nepal. “While addressing people with disabilities, knowingly or unknowingly, many of us use undignified and incorrect terminologies. These words will have negative impact on both the personal and professional development of people with disabilities,” reads the statement on the organisation’s website.

                Guru Purnima: The most influential Gurus in our lives
              </h3>
              <button type="button" class="btn view-project-btn">

                  <p>
                    Gurus not only teach us but also believe in us. Gu and Ru are the root words of the word Guru. Gu in Sanskrit means darkness or ignorance, and Ru means remover. The word Guru can be described as one who removes the darkness of ignorance from our lives. It is common for people to view their Gurus as the most meaningful part of their lives. This is the day when disciples pay homage to their Gurus by performing pooja.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Learn from everyone</h4>
                  <p>
                    Our lives are filled with learning. From the day we are born, we learn from others. We meet people, build connections, find mentors and get advice from them. In fact, every person that we meet knows something we do not know. The people we cross paths with in our lives have something to teach us if we are open to gaining knowledge from them. They have explained everything to us in the most efficient way possible. They have imparted to us all the basic manners and etiquettes of discipline, punctuality, kindness and empathy. They encouraged us to be fearless.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They have empowered us to stand up for ourselves and speak out when something seems wrong. We have learned to always have faith and confidence through them.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Feeling thankful</h4>
                  <p>
                    At every turning point in our life that required guidance, we have been fortunate to have people who have served as Gurus. Our parents, brothers, sisters, wife, teachers, friends, bosses, colleagues, and even random people have pushed us forward or taught us something valuable in a short period.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, in that way we need to realize we are very thankful for having such people in our life. No matter what, all of us may not have had the same Guru, but these are the people we ought to consider as our Gurus. Moreover, all the directors we have worked with are very competent, and we need to consider them to be our Gurus as well.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Understanding one’s worth
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    They have guided us to know and understand our worth. They have taught us to never give up and always believe in diligent work. They have demonstrated to us the power of spirituality. They have also taught us to be independent and empowered us to make our own decisions. They have always stood behind us as a rock and will continue doing so as we face the real world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Guru Purnima was the morning I first got in touch with my first Guru, who taught me alphabets, numbers, voices, grammar, and so on. I knew he was hospitalized, but he is recovering well and will be discharged very soon. In the afternoon, I drove to meet with my spiritual Guru in person who taught me the value of truthfulness, mental peace, brotherhood and cooperation. Later in the evening, I was able to attend a spiritual program with my childhood friends. The day was a bit busy but it was worth it because I needed it.

                    Without value for yourself, your work, your time, and your health, others will take advantage of you. Focus on valuing yourself and keep those who respect those values close to you. Cook more at home. Dining out should not be the norm, but an occasional treat every now and then is totally fine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Place yourself first on your care list before taking on the needs of others. Taking care of yourself is just as significant as helping those around you. Reserve time to rest and be quiet. You can reenergize yourself by setting aside a day each week or time each month.

                    As we celebrated Guru Purnima this week, by honoring the contributions of our Gurus in our lives, we would need to thank the almighty for putting us in the hands of such people who have sacrificed endlessly for us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our parents instilled the highest values in us, making us the person we are today. To the ones who always guide us down the right path; wish all the Gurus, a Happy Guru Purnima. Who do you think has been the most influential Gurus in our lives? Throughout the rest of our lives, we will strive to continue to make them proud and look up to them in everything we do and achieve.
                  </p>
